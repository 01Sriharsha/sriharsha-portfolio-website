# My Portfolio Website

![Portfolio Screenshot](/public/portfolio-website-thumbnail.png)

I have recently developed my personal portfolio website using a stack of modern technologies and libraries. This website is designed to showcase my skills, projects, experiences, and provide a platform for easy contact. Here's a breakdown of the key components and technologies I used:

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/)
- **JavaScript Library**: [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- **CSS Framework**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Features

### Smooth Animations

I used [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to create smooth and eye-catching animations throughout the website, providing an engaging user experience.

### Email Styling

For sending styled emails from the contact form, I integrated the [react-email](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-email) library, which helped in crafting visually appealing email responses to user inquiries.

### Serverless Email Sending

I leveraged the latest server actions introduced in Next.js 13 to send emails without the need for a separate API endpoint. This ensures a streamlined and efficient email communication process.

### Email Sending

For email communication, I integrated the [resend](https://resend.com/) and [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) library, allowing for efficient and secure email sending and handling of inquiries.

### Schema Validation

To validate and parse the data received from the contact form, I utilized [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), a TypeScript-first data validation library, ensuring data consistency and security.

### Toast Notifications

For displaying styled toasts and alerts throughout the website, I integrated [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/), enhancing the user experience by providing feedback on various interactions.

### Dark and Light Theme

To accommodate user preferences, I implemented a dark and light theme toggle, allowing visitors to switch between different color schemes for improved readability and accessibility.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), ensuring public availability and scalability. You can check out the live version of my portfolio website [here]("https://sriharsha.vercel.app/).

This portfolio website showcases my skills, projects, and experiences while incorporating modern technologies and practices to provide a smooth and engaging user experience. It also facilitates easy communication with me through the contact form.
